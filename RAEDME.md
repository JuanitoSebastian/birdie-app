# Birdie
This is my solution for the [Reaktor 2023 Developer Trainee pre-assignment](https://assignments.reaktor.com/birdnest/). It's a simple web app that shows the user a list of drone pilots who have violated a no-flight zone during the last 10 minutes.

## Running locally
The app can be run locally using docker. Make sure you have docker and docker-compose installed and clone the repository. Then run the following command in the root of the project:
```
docker-compose up
```
The app can be viewed at `http://localhost:8080/`.
